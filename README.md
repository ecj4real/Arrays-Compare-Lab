# COMPARING TWO ARRAYS
You are presented with two arrays, all containing positive integers. Create a function findMissing(arr1, arr2) that takes in two arguments, both of which are arrays. One of the arrays will have one extra number, see below
* [1,2,3] and [1,2,3,4] should return 4
* [4,66,7] and [66,77,7,4] should return 77
